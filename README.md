# Stack: LinkedList Stack Implementation in C++
### This is an implementation of a stack data structure using a linked list in C++. The implementation provides basic stack operations such as push, pop, top, and isEmpty.

### Class Definition
- linkiedlistStack() - Constructor that initializes the Variables.
- linkiedlistStack() - Copy constructor that creates a new linked list stack that is a copy of another linked list stack passed to it as a parameter.
- ~linkiedlistStack() - Destructor that deallocates memory used by the linked list stack.
- initializeStack() - Method that deallocates memory used by the linked list stack.
- push() - Method that adds a new item to the top of the stack.
- pop() - Method that removes the top item from the stack.
- top()  - Method that returns the value of the top item in the stack.
- isEmpty()  - Method that returns a boolean value indicating whether the stack is empty or not.
- copyStack() - Method that creates a new linked list stack that is a copy of another linked list stack passed to it as a parameter.
